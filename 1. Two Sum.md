## ðŸš€ LeetCode Notes - 1. Two Sum

URL: https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/

Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

Example 1:
Input: nums = `[2,7,11,15], target = 9`
Output: `[0,1]`
Explanation: Because `nums[0] + nums[1] == 9`, we return `[0, 1]`.

Example 2:
Input: `nums = [3,2,4], target = 6`
Output: `[1,2]`

Example 3:
Input: `nums = [3,3], target = 6`
Output: `[0,1]`

### Approach 1: Brute Force
The brute force approach involves checking each pair of numbers to see if they add up to the target. This is done by using two nested loops: the outer loop iterates through each element, and the inner loop checks all subsequent elements to find a pair that adds up to the target.

- **Time Complexity**: O(n^2), where n is the number of elements in the array. Each element is compared with every other element.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as no additional space is required apart from the input array.

```python
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        for i in range(len(nums) - 1):
            for j in range(i + 1, len(nums)):
                if nums[i] + nums[j] == target:
                    return [i, j]
        return []
```

### Approach 2: Hashmap
This approach uses a hashmap (dictionary in Python) to store the indices of the elements. As we iterate through the array, we check if the complement (target - current number) exists in the hashmap. If it does, we have found the pair and return their indices.

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), as we traverse the list containing n elements only once. Each look-up in the table costs only O(1) time.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), as we need to store at most n elements in the hashmap.

```python
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        num_to_index = {}
        for i, num in enumerate(nums):
            complement = target - num
            if complement in num_to_index:
                return [num_to_index[complement], i]
            num_to_index[num] = i
        return []
```

### Approach 3: Two Pointers
First, we sort the array while keeping track of the original indices using enumeration. Then, we use two pointers to scan through the array from both ends. If the sum of the two pointed numbers is less than the target, we move the left pointer to the right. If the sum is more, we move the right pointer to the left. We continue this until we find the exact sum.

- **Time Complexity**: O(nlogn) due to the sort operation. The two-pointer traversal itself is O(n).
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) to store the original indices along with the sorted numbers.

```python
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        nums = sorted(enumerate(nums), key=lambda x: x[1])
        left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1
        while left < right:
            total = nums[left][1] + nums[right][1]
            if total == target:
                return [nums[left][0], nums[right][0]]
            elif total < target:
                left += 1
            else:
                right -= 1
        return []
```

### Approach 4: Two Hashmaps
Similar to the single hashmap approach, but with a slight variation. In the first pass, we populate a hashmap with each number's index. In the second pass, we check if each number's complement exists in the hashmap (and is not the number itself) and return the indices if found.

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), as we traverse the list twice.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), due to the additional storage required for the hashmap.

```python
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        num_to_index = {}
        for i, num in enumerate(nums):
            num_to_index[num] = i
        for i, num in enumerate(nums):
            complement = target - num
            if complement in num_to_index and num_to_index[complement] != i:
                return [i, num_to_index[complement]]
        return []
```

Each approach has its trade-offs in terms of time and space complexity, and the best choice depends on the specific requirements and constraints of the problem at hand.
